        "### This is not accurate\n",
        "Subtitle Dubbing Tool is a convenient utility designed to assist in the process of dubbing subtitles for videos. This tool streamlines the workflow by integrating audio upload, automatic subtitle generation, translation, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Upload Audio:**\n",
        "   - Begin by uploading the audio file corresponding to the video content you wish to dub.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Whisper to Generate Subtitle (.srt) Format:**\n",
        "   - Utilize the whisper feature to automatically generate subtitles in the .srt format. This feature transcribes the spoken content of the uploaded audio into text, ensuring accurate representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Google Translate for Translation:**\n",
        "   - Translate the generated subtitles into your desired language using Google Translate. This step ensures that your subtitles are accessible to a broader audience by providing translations in multiple languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Edge TTS for Multilingual TTS:**\n",
        "   - Employ Edge TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionality to convert the translated subtitles into speech. This enables the creation of dubbed audio tracks in various languages, enhancing the accessibility and reach of your video content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Follow the numbered steps listed above to sequentially navigate through the subtitle dubbing process.\n",
        "- Ensure that the uploaded audio file is clear and of sufficient quality to facilitate accurate transcription and dubbing.\n",
        "- Review and refine the generated subtitles and translations as necessary to maintain accuracy and coherence.\n",
        "- Experiment with different languages and TTS voices offered by Edge TTS to customize the dubbing experience according to your preferences and audience demographics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Subtitle Dubbing Tool is intended to streamline the dubbing process and enhance the accessibility of video content by providing automated transcription, translation, and text-to-speech functionalities.\n",
        "- While the tool aims to produce accurate results, it is advisable to review the generated subtitles and translations for any errors or discrepancies.\n",
        "- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome to continually enhance the functionality and usability of the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thank you for using Subtitle Dubbing Tool!"
